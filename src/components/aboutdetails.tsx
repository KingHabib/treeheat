            <h2>What is Tree Heat?</h2>
            <p>Tree Heat is an interactive map that allows users to explore the temperature benefit
                that trees bring to its surrounding environment.</p>
            <h2>Why trees?</h2>
            <p>Trees are able to cool the air around them by blocking harsh sunlight from reaching the surrounding surface.
                In addition, trees also absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere along with light through a process commonly
                known as photosynthesis.
